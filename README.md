# UK Employment Data Analysis 🚀

## Project Overview

In this project, I worked on analyzing the **UK Employment Dataset** to gain insights into job distribution across cities, focusing on salary trends, industry performance, and other employment-related metrics. The dataset was cleaned and transformed using **Excel**, and then imported into **Tableau** for visualization. This project leverages several powerful features within Tableau, such as **filters**, **dual-axis charts**, **geographical mapping**, **interactive dashboards**, and more.

### Key Steps and Techniques 🔍

1. **Data Cleaning and Transformation** 🧹
   - The **UK Employment Dataset** was first cleaned and transformed, with the data source relationship established within Tableau.
   - Data was **extracted**, organized into **dimensions** and **measures**, and used for subsequent analysis.

2. **Filtering and Focusing** 🔍
   - **Filters** were applied to focus on specific subsets of data, allowing for a detailed look at specific cities, job types, or industries.
   - **Interactive Filters** were used to dynamically update visualizations based on user input, providing real-time insights into the dataset.

3. **Legends Customization** 🎨
   - **Legends** (size, color, label) were used to highlight calculated fields and percentages to improve the clarity of the data representation.
   - **Tooltip Customization** was used to include relevant level-of-detail expressions, providing more granular control over data aggregation and calculation.

4. **Dual-Axis Charts** 📊
   - **Dual-Axis Charts** were utilized to compare two measures on the same chart, making it easier to visualize relationships between different job metrics, such as salaries and number of positions.

5. **Geographical Mapping** 🌍
   - A **Geographical Map** was created to visualize the **Top 10 City Jobs** in the UK, with **color legends** representing high salaries, providing a geographic perspective of the job market.

6. **Table Calculations** 🧮
   - **Table Calculations** such as **average** and **sum** were performed to analyze top city jobs in the UK and identify salary patterns.

7. **Trend Lines and Forecasting** 📈
   - **Trend lines** and **forecasting** features were activated to project job trends and salary changes over time.

8. **Data Blending** 🔄
   - **Data Blending** was used to combine data from multiple sources within a single visualization. This enabled more comprehensive analysis and a unified view of the dataset.

9. **Dashboard Creation** 🖥️
   - **Interactive Dashboards** were created by combining filters and applying them to multiple worksheets. This helped create real-time, interactive visualizations that communicate insights effectively.

### Visualizations and Insights 📊

#### 1. **Top 10 Jobs with High Salaries** 💰
   - Using functions like **average**, **mode**, and **percentage**, I highlighted the **Top 10 Jobs** with the highest salaries across industries. A **bar chart** was used for clear comparison between different job types and their respective salaries.

#### 4. **Interactive Dashborad Showing Average Salary Change by City** 📉
   - A **Dashboard ** was used to visualize the **average percentage change** in salaries by city across different job categories. This helped identify trends and forecast salary growth or decline in specific cities.

### Key Insights 🎯

- **City-Wise Salary Distribution**: Cities with the highest-paying jobs are clustered in specific regions, indicating strong regional economic trends.
- **Industry Analysis**: Certain industries show a consistent growth in salaries, while others may require more investment to boost wages.
- **Forecasting & Trends**: **Trend lines** and **forecasting** provided insights into potential future salary trends, helping companies and professionals make more informed decisions.
- **Salary Patterns**: Analysis of the **Top 10 Jobs with High Salaries** revealed a strong preference for skilled labor and high-demand positions, such as in the tech and healthcare industries.

### Conclusion 🎯

This project demonstrates the power of **Tableau** and data visualization techniques to uncover insights in employment data. By leveraging **filters**, **dual-axis charts**, **geographical mapping**, and **interactive dashboards**, I was able to provide a comprehensive and visually engaging analysis of the UK employment landscape. The project not only shows salary trends but also provides actionable insights into the most lucrative job opportunities across various cities and industries
